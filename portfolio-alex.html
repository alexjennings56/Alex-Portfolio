					<p>Hello, i'm Alex. I'm am currently training to become a full stack developer studying at Mayden Academy in Bath England. I was formally training as a Royal Marine Commando but needed extra experience to join my desired troop, 30 commando Information Exploitation Group. So i believe that becoming a full stack developer will aid me massivally in this! I very much enjoy being a developer equally as much as the military side of things so wish to join back, this time into the researves! In my free time I like to play the guitar, wild camp and hike as they're all very relaxing and enables my mind to rest.</p>
