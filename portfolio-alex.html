					<p>Hello, i'm Alex! I'm am currently training to become a full stack developer studying at Mayden Academy in Bath England. In my free time I like to relax by playing the guitar and listening to music (rock and opera being my two personal favorites). I also ocationally play games on my computer. I have skills in team working, leadership and time management as I was previously training down in Lympstone as a Royal Marine Commando where they were very much breed into you.</p>
